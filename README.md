# strangersThings
2nd Graded Project for CalPoly Extended Edu Coding Bootcamp

// This self-led build focused on developing front-end dev. skills including but not limited to: JS Basics, AJAX HTTP methods, asynchronous processes, DOM manipulation, etc.

//Scope/limitations:

  // User data unsecure due to lack of backend processes( e.g. JWT, etc).
  // Refactoring needed for "Messages" button in nav bar for "Authenticated User" view
  // Refactoring essential for successful use of state instead of over-reliance on AJAX calls

// End goal:
  // to create a User Experience that was simple & intuitive to use.  The overall purpose being that users could post objects for sale
  // and interact with sellers in a simplified & stylish, "craigslist-type" of environment.
